# Milestone-Project-


This is a Milestone project to be implemnted using html and CSS some additional Bootstrap is also used for this project. The Website is about for Gym to give it an an online presence.

UX
Tried to make the page fit for the theme and colour of the Gym. So the aim is to help the Gym to get customers.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
